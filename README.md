# sarahtanja-coralRNA Repository 

This repository is for a differential gene expression (DGE) workflow for a multiple stressor treatment experiment on *Montipora capitata* corals. In this repo I will be using 'fake data' from [Ariana Huffmyer's](https://github.com/AHuffmyer) [EarlyLifeHistory_Energetics](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/EarlyLifeHistory_Energetics) repository as a placeholder until I get RNAseq data from my own experiment.

## RNAseq data:

'fake data' is sourced from a *Montipora capitata* ontogeny time series, which is a series of samples taken by A. Huffmyer at different life-history stages of *Montipora capitata* coral (i.e., embryos, larvae, recruits). Raw sequence files can be found on NCBI SRA under BioProject [PRJNA900235](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA900235).
