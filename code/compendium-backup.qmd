## Overview
In this analysis, we are going to look at the differentially expressed genes, and their functions, between coral larvae and coral recruits. The data for this is borrowed from [Dr. Ariana Huffmyer's](https://linktr.ee/ashuffmyer) study on *Montipora capitata* [Early Life History Energetics](https://github.com/AHuffmyer/EarlyLifeHistory_Energetics).

I will compare RNA expression between 4 larvae, and 4 recruits.

The larvae are torpedo-shaped, and have a brown core like a chocolate-filled eclair. The brown color is from the algal symbionts which enter the Pocillopora damicornis larvae before they are released during brooder spawning by adult corals."}](https://www.vims.edu/newsandevents/topstories/2018/coral_genex.php)

### End Goal
The end goal of this analysis is to develop a heatmap that shows the top 20 differentially expressed gene functions between the coral larvae life stage and the coral recruit life stage.

### Code Pipeline
#### Step 1. [Get Sequence & Genome Data using `curl`and `wget`](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047965)

#### Step 2. [Align Sequences to a Genome using `kallisto`](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047958)

#### Step 3. [Identify Differential Gene Expression using `DESeq2`](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047962)

#### Step 4. [Annotate the Reference Transcriptome using `UniProt` and `BLAST`](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047968)

#### Step 5. [Merge the Annotated Transcriptome with the List of Differentially Expressed Genes](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047972)

#### Step 6. [Visualize the Top Differentially Expressed Genes and their Functions](https://rpubs.com/sarah_tanja/1047950)
